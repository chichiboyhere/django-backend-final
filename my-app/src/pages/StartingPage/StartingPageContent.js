        skills.  You will be
        flashed a mathematical problem with four options from which you're to
        pick an answer. If the option picked is correct, your score will be
        increased by one, else it remains the same. The Verbal Aptitude, on the other hand tests how good the students is in communication,
        via written words. At the end of each of the tests you will receive a final score in percentage.
        You will also get your score per second(SPS) -- which
        basically judges the rate at which you proferred a solution to the
        problems. That is your score divided by the time you spent on the
        test."
